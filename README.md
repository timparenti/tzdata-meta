# tzdata-meta

**[View the metadata](https://tzdata-meta.timtimeonline.com/)**

This repository aims to document metadata
regarding changes to timezone data as they are
communicated to the [`tz` discussion list](https://lists.iana.org/postorius/lists/tz.iana.org/),
added to the [`tz` development repository](https://github.com/eggert/tz),
and released [via IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones),
to encourage timely notification of timezone changes
which permit timely dissemination.
For more information, please read Matt Johnson's 2016-04-23 blog post,
["On the Timing of Time Zone Changes"](https://codeofmatt.com/on-the-timing-of-time-zone-changes/).

The metadata compiled herewithin is secondary to the `tz` repository,
and is derived from the [archives of the `tz` discussion list](https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz@iana.org/)
as well as [commits to the `tz` development repository](https://github.com/eggert/tz/commits/main).
Pull requests will *NOT* be accepted for a given timezone change until
it has been proposed to the `tz` mailing list at [tz@iana.org](mailto:tz@iana.org),
discussed as necessary,
committed to the `tz` development repository,
and (in general) released.
